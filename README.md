Abstract, for reference: 

Although sports analytics captured national attention only in 2011 with the release of Moneyball, research in the field is nearly a century old. Until relatively recently, this research was largely done by hand; however, the heavily quantitative nature of sports analytics makes it an attractive target for machine learning. This paper explores the application of advanced machine learning models to predict team performance in National Basketball Association (NBA) regular season and playoff games. Several models were trained on a rich dataset spanning 73 years, which includes individual player metrics, opponent-based performance, and team composition. The core of our analysis lies in combining individual player metrics, opponent-based game performances, and team chemistry, extending beyond traditional stat line analysis by incorporating nuanced factors. We employ various machine learning techniques, including neural networks and gradient boosting machines, to generate predictive models for player performance and compare their performance with both each other and traditional predictive models. Our analysis suggests that gradient boosting machines and neural networks significantly outperform other models. Neural networks demonstrate significant effectiveness in handling complex, non-linear data interrelations, while gradient boosting machines excel in identifying intricate predictor interactions. Our findings emphasize the immense potential of sophisticated machine learning techniques in sports analytics and mark a growing shift towards computer-aided and computer-based approaches in sports analytics.
